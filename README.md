# Getting Started
1. Ensure all the files listed under 'Files' below are in the same folder
(click clone or download in [this](https://github.com/Aqueum/UFS-Portfolio) 
& follow instructions)
2. Open JaneDoette2.html in your browser


# How to create your own portfolio
Edit the JaneDoette2.html file's h1, h3, h4, a & p tags

## Fonts
`strings design-mockup-portfolio.pdf | grep FontName`
yields
`<< /Type /FontDescriptor /FontName /OYETYJ+OpenSans /Flags 4 /FontBBox 
[-550 -271 1204 1048]`
so I used google's OpenSans, but looking at the upper case J's this clearly
isn't quite right.

The overlapping font set given when entering images of "Jane Doette" and 
"Featured Work" into WhatTheFont was SmytheSans (thin & regular respectively)
but these aren't available at reasonable cost for a MOOC...

# Contributing
This is an assessed project, so I'd probably get in trouble for accepting 
external advice.
Feel free to fork as long as you're not using this as part of your own 
coursework.
